Journey starts here .....

I think the best way to learn is create a CRUD app, then add routing to view detail of a todo. Then add user authentication on your app to implement user authorization to post view delete update etc. then add search function to search todos. And finally add sorting by dates, desc or asc. I think it covers all the fundamental stuff.
